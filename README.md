# Timer
A timer app for iOS 10 written entirely in Swift 3.0, without Xcode's interface builder.

## Reason for project
This is rather a beginner's project, but for the sake of learning more about iOS Development without the interface builder,
I took on this challenge. Another reason is, because I haven't been making much of working iOS apps recently.

## Authorization
Anyone is allowed to use this project for further development, as well as teaching themselves.
Mentioning me would be appreciated!
